### A collection of map-driven experiments
<hr/>

This repository contains all my map-driven experiments. Some of them are from the early 2020s, found them in a backup hard drive and pushing them online now ðŸ¥² 
- <b>ArtMap</b> : A map-based plot of artworks and artifacts from museums (circa ~2022). It currently only supports the data pulled from the Harvard API. Support for more museums and collections shall be added soon-ish. Play around with it [here](https://shuvam.xyz/maps/artmap/index.html).
- <b>WikiMap</b> : A geospatial plot of wikipedia articles (circa ~2022). You can play around with this [here](https://shuvam.xyz/maps/wikimap/index.html)

The ArtMap project was initially inspired from the [Museo project](https://museo.app/) by [Chase McCoy](https://x.com/chase_mccoy). Had so much fun working with this that I jumped on to a whole new set of map-driven projects, leading to WikiMap!
